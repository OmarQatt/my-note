Developers who donâ€™t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems. It can become a vicious cycle: misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.

When faced with the fact that their code will change in the future, some developers attempt to solve the problem by designing a solution so generic that it will accommodate to every possible future situation.

Most probably, this time will never come and the code you wrote to solve future problems will increase complexity, make it hard to change the pieces of code and eventually it will become a burden that may destroy your software.

While you want to avoid having less code, you can easily fall in a trap that will cause you to write clever code that is hard to understand for others.

The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

When other developers in your team see that you committed new code to source control, everyone should know that your code is tested, and works.
