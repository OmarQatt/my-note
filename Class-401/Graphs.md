Graph

# Graph : is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
# The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

# Types of Graphs: 

## 1. Finite Graphs
A graph is said to be finite if it has a finite number of vertices and a finite number of edges. 
## 2. Infinite Graph
A graph is said to be infinite if it has an infinite number of vertices as well as an infinite number of edges. 
## 3. Trivial Graph
A graph is said to be trivial if a finite graph contains only one vertex and no edge.
## 4. Simple Graph
A simple graph is a graph that does not contain more than one edge between the pair of vertices. A simple railway track connecting different cities is an example of a simple graph. 
## 5. Multi Graph
Any graph which contains some parallel edges but doesn’t contain any self-loop is called a multigraph. For example a Road Map. 
## 6. Null Graph
A graph of order n and size zero is a graph where there are only isolated vertices with no edges connecting any pair of vertices.
## 7. Complete Graph
A simple graph with n vertices is called a complete graph if the degree of each vertex is n-1, that is, one vertex is attached with n-1 edges or the rest of the vertices in the graph.
A complete graph is also called Full Graph. 
## 8. Pseudo Graph
A graph G with a self-loop and some multiple edges is called a pseudo graph. 
## 9. Regular Graph
A simple graph is said to be regular if all vertices of graph G are of equal degree. All complete graphs are regular but vice versa is not possible. 
## 10. Bipartite Graph
A graph G = (V, E) is said to be a bipartite graph if its vertex set V(G) can be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint subsets.
## 11. Labeled Graph
If the vertices and edges of a graph are labeled with name, date, or weight then it is called a labeled graph. It is also called Weighted Graph. 
## 12. Digraph Graph it also called(Directed Graph)
A graph G = (V, E) with a mapping f such that every edge maps onto some ordered pair of vertices (Vi, Vj) are called a Digraph.
## 13. Subgraph
A graph G1 = (V1, E1) is called a subgraph of a graph G(V, E) if V1(G) is a subset of V(G) and E1(G) is a subset of E(G) such that each edge of G1 has same end vertices as in G. 
## 14. Connected or Disconnected Graph
Graph G is said to be connected if any pair of vertices (Vi, Vj) of a graph G is reachable from one another.
## 15. Cyclic Graph
A graph G consisting of n vertices and n> = 3 that is V1, V2, V3- – – – Vn and edges (V1, V2), (V2, V3), (V3, V4)- – – – (Vn, V1) are called cyclic graph. 
## 16. Types of Subgraphs
there is two type of subgraphs
## Vertex disjoint subgraph: 
Any two graph G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) are said to be vertex disjoint of a graph G = (V, E) if V1(G1) intersection V2(G2) = null.
In the figure, there is no common vertex between G1 and G2.
## Edge disjoint subgraph:
A subgraph is said to be edge-disjoint if E1(G1) intersection E2(G2) = null. In the figure, there is no common edge between G1 and G2.

# Graph vs Tree
The basis of Comparison  | Graph | Tree
------------- | ------------- | ------------|
Definition  | Graph is a non-linear data structure. 	  | Tree is a non-linear data structure.
Types of Edges  | They can be directed or undirected.  | They are always directed.

# Basic Properties of a Graph
A  Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

# some basic properties of graph theory:
1  Distance between two vertices
2. Eccentricity of a vertex
3. Radius of connected Graph
