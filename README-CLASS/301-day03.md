## If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a li element for each item.
Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems:
Then, we can include the entire listItems array inside a ul element
## Each list item needs a unique
Key
## What is the purpose of a key?
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.


##  In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
