## What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST is an architectural system centered around resources and Hypermedia using HTTP commands.
CRUD is a cycle meant to maintain records in a database setting.

## If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
