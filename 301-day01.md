# Component-Based Architecture

## What is a “component”?

A Component is considered as the core building blocks of a React application.
It makes the task of building UIs much easier.
Each component exists in the same space, but they work independently
from one another and merge all in a parent component, which will be the final UI of your application.

## What are the characteristics of a component?

Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

## What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

# What is Props and How to Use it in React

## What is “props” short for?
props stands for properties.

## How are props used in React?

Step 1 - Pass in props as an argument
Step 2 - Declare props variable(s)
Step 3 - Use variable(s) in JSX template
Step 4 - Pass data to props in the App component

## What is the flow of props?

One way to call a child component's function from its parent is with the help of the useRef hook.
